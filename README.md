# Build_LookML_Objects_in_Looker
Earn a skill badge by completing the Build LookML Objects in Looker quest, where you will learn how to do the following: design/build new dimensions and measures, views, and derived tables, set measure filters and types based on requirements, update dimensions and measures (change names, use aliases), build and refine Explores, join views to existing Explores, and decide which LookML objects to create based on business requirements.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge quest and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

Looker is a modern data platform in Google Cloud that lets you analyze and visualize your data interactively. You can use Looker to do in-depth data analysis, integrate insights across different data sources, build actionable data-driven workflows, and create custom data applications.


## What is LookML?
LookML (Looker Modeling Language) generates abstracted SQL and provides a modeling layer between the database and user. It is Lookerâ€™s proprietary language that provides an abstraction layer for SQL databases.

Specifically, LookML is a language for describing dimensions, aggregates, calculations, and data relationships in a SQL database. Looker uses a model written in LookML to construct SQL queries against a particular database. It creates the layer between that SQL database and how the business user interacts with it.

As such, it defines many different things, like how to join tables, how to define custom tables, how to define fields from the database, and the logic for new fields. In this lab, you will get hands-on experience with the fundamentals of LookML.
